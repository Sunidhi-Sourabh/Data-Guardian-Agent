## 5. Quick‑Start Scripts

### 5.1 Redacting Logs (Node.js example)

```js
// logger.js
const winston = require('winston');
const { combine, timestamp, printf } = winston.format;

const redact = (info) => {
  if (info.message.includes('api_key=')) {
    info.message = info.message.replace(/api_key=\w+/g, 'api_key=REDACTED');
  }
  return info;
};

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: combine(
    timestamp(),
    redact(),
    printf(({ timestamp, level, message }) => `${timestamp} [${level}]: ${message}`)
  ),
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()]
});

module.exports = logger;
```

### 5.2 .env‑Based Secret Injection

```bash
# Docker Compose example
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}
```

Make sure `.env` is **never** committed (`.gitignore`).

### 5.3 Secret Rotation Script (Python)

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def rotate_api_key(name):
    client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
    try:
        # Create a new secret value
        new_value = 'new-secret-' + secrets.token_hex(16)
        client.put_secret_value(SecretId=name, SecretString=new_value)
        # Update config / env files (pseudo‑code)
        update_app_config(name, new_value)
        print(f"Rotated {name}")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error rotating {name}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rotate_api_key('myapp/api_key')
```

## 6. Final Take‑Home

1. **The exposed API key is a *critical* breach.** Revoke, rotate, and purge logs now.
2. **No .env discipline + no fallback auth** are *moderate hygiene gaps* that will make future leaks harder to manage. Fix them before the next incident.
3. **Automate everything** – secrets, logging, scanning, and rotation.
4. **Treat logs as a first‑class asset** – encrypt, restrict, and scrub them.
5. **Add fallback & validation** to protect users and services from denial‑of‑service or injection attacks.

Once the immediate actions are done, move into the hygiene checklist and establish a continuous improvement loop. This will transform the incident from a one‑off leak into a learning opportunity that hardens your entire stack.

| **Audit the Source** | Search the repo & CI logs for `12345` or the key pattern. | Detect if the key is stored elsewhere. |
| **Purge Logs** | Delete or redact the log entries that contain the key. | Prevent future accidental exposure. |
| **Disable Logging of Sensitive Data** | Temporarily suppress logging of any request headers, query params, or body that might contain secrets. | Stops the leak from continuing. |
| **Notify Stakeholders** | Inform security, ops, and product teams. | Enables coordinated response and communication. |
| **Run a Quick Scan** | Use a secret‑scanning tool (e.g., TruffleHog, GitLeaks, or your own regex) to find other leaks. | Catch any additional exposed credentials. |

### 3.2 Hygiene & Process Fixes (≤ 1 day)

| Fix | Implementation |
|-----|----------------|
| **.env Discipline** | • Store all secrets in `.env` files **only** for local dev.<br>• Use environment variables in production (e.g., via Docker secrets, K8s secrets, or CI/CD env vars). |
| **Secrets Manager** | Adopt a dedicated secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager). |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | • Mark secrets as protected variables.<br>• Prevent them from being printed in logs (`echo $SECRET` → `echo "******"`). |
| **Code Review Checklist** | Add a “No Secrets in Code” rule. |
| **Automated Secret Scanning** | Run scans on every PR and on a nightly schedule. |
| **Logging Policy** | • Strip out headers, query params, and body fields that contain secrets.<br>• Use a log‑scrubbing middleware. |
| **Encryption at Rest** | Ensure logs are encrypted (e.g., CloudWatch logs encryption, Loki, Elasticsearch with encryption). |
| **Access Controls** | Limit who can read logs to the minimum required. |
| **Monitoring / Alerting** | Create alerts for any new `api_key=` patterns in logs. |

### 3.3 Authentication & Fallback Improvements (≤ 2 days)

| Gap | Fix |
|-----|-----|
| No fallback | • Implement 2FA (TOTP, SMS, Authenticator app).<br>• Add “Forgot password” flow that uses a verified email or phone. |
| No rate limiting | Add per‑IP and per‑user rate limits to prevent brute force. |
| No payload validation | Use a schema validator (JSON Schema, Joi, etc.) and reject malformed requests early. |
| WAF / IDS | Deploy a Web Application Firewall or an IDS that flags malformed or suspicious payloads. |

### 3.4 Long‑Term Strategy (≥ 1 week)

| Initiative | Goal |
|------------|------|
| **Secret Lifecycle Management** | Automate rotation (e.g., every 90 days) and enforce revocation on compromise. |
| **Zero‑Trust Architecture** | Treat all network traffic as untrusted; enforce least‑privilege for services. |
| **Security Training** | Regular training for developers on secrets hygiene, logging, and secure coding. |
| **Incident Response Playbook** | Define steps for credential leaks, including communication templates. |
| **Compliance Audits** | Run periodic audits (SOC‑2, ISO 27001, etc.) to ensure controls are effective. |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Deploy SIEM or SOAR that correlates logs, detects anomalies, and triggers auto‑remediation. |

## 5. Quick‑Start Scripts

### 5.1 Redacting Logs (Node.js example)

```js
// logger.js
const winston = require('winston');
const { combine, timestamp, printf } = winston.format;

const redact = (info) => {
  if (info.message.includes('api_key=')) {
    info.message = info.message.replace(/api_key=\w+/g, 'api_key=REDACTED');
  }
  return info;
};

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: combine(
    timestamp(),
    redact(),
    printf(({ timestamp, level, message }) => `${timestamp} [${level}]: ${message}`)
  ),
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()]
});

module.exports = logger;
```

### 5.2 .env‑Based Secret Injection

```bash
# Docker Compose example
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}
```

Make sure `.env` is **never** committed (`.gitignore`).

### 5.3 Secret Rotation Script (Python)

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def rotate_api_key(name):
    client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
    try:
        # Create a new secret value
        new_value = 'new-secret-' + secrets.token_hex(16)
        client.put_secret_value(SecretId=name, SecretString=new_value)
        # Update config / env files (pseudo‑code)
        update_app_config(name, new_value)
        print(f"Rotated {name}")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error rotating {name}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rotate_api_key('myapp/api_key')
```

## 6. Final Take‑Home

1. **The exposed API key is a *critical* breach.** Revoke, rotate, and purge logs now.
2. **No .env discipline + no fallback auth** are *moderate hygiene gaps* that will make future leaks harder to manage. Fix them before the next incident.
3. **Automate everything** – secrets, logging, scanning, and rotation.
4. **Treat logs as a first‑class asset** – encrypt, restrict, and scrub them.
5. **Add fallback & validation** to protect users and services from denial‑of‑service or injection attacks.

Once the immediate actions are done, move into the hygiene checklist and establish a continuous improvement loop. This will transform the incident from a one‑off leak into a learning opportunity that hardens your entire stack.
