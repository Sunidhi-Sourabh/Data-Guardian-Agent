# 🧠 DataGuardian Agent – Risk Summary

## 🔍 Tagged Logs
🔴 Critical → api_key=12345EXPOSED
🟠 Moderate → User login failed: no fallback configured
🟠 Moderate → Missing .env discipline in deployment
🟢 Low → Secure endpoint hit with malformed payload

## 🛠️ Recommendations
## 1. Quick‑Fire Assessment

| Log | Severity | What it means | Immediate Action |
|-----|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 🔴 **api_key=12345EXPOSED** | **Critical** | A production‑grade API key is in plain text in a log. Anyone who can read the logs now has a valid key. | **Revoke & rotate the key immediately.** Delete the old key from any codebase, CI/CD, and environment files. |
| 🟠 **User login failed: no fallback configured** | **Moderate** | When the primary auth method fails, the system doesn’t switch to an alternative (e.g., secondary MFA, password reset, or a backup token). | Implement a graceful fallback path or a retry mechanism. |
| 🟠 **Missing .env discipline in deployment** | **Moderate** | Secrets are likely being baked into images or hard‑coded in config files. | Enforce `.env` usage (or a secrets manager) and keep files out of version control. |
| 🟢 **Secure endpoint hit with malformed payload** | **Low** | Payload validation is weak or missing. | Add strict schema validation and sanitization. |

## 2. Credential Leak – API Key

| Issue | Why it matters | Recovery Steps |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Exposed key in logs | Anyone who reads the logs can impersonate the service, read/write data, or incur charges. | 1. **Revoke** the key in the provider console. <br>2. **Rotate** – generate a new key, update all environments, and test. <br>3. **Scrub** old logs: redact the key (`api_key=REDACTED`) in future logs, and if possible purge the exposed logs. <br>4. **Audit**: run a scan for the key string across the repo, CI scripts, Dockerfiles, and any artifact. |
| Logging sensitive data | Logs are often stored for weeks/months. | • Add a **log filter** that masks or drops any field named `api_key`, `password`, `token`, etc. <br>• Configure your log aggregation tool (ELK, Splunk, CloudWatch) to redact these fields. |

---

## 3. Fallback Gaps – User Login

| Problem | Suggested Fix |
|---------|---------------|
| No fallback on login failure | • Implement a **multi‑factor fallback** (e.g., if primary MFA fails, prompt for a backup code). <br>• Add a **retry counter** and a **temporary lockout** with a fallback to password reset. <br>• Ensure the fallback path also respects rate‑limiting and does not expose additional secrets. |
| Logging fallback attempts | Log each fallback attempt, but mask any credentials. |

## 4. Hygiene – Missing `.env` Discipline

| Current State | Risks | Recommendations |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| Secrets baked into images or hard‑coded | Hard to rotate, risk of accidental commit, hard to audit | 1. **Adopt a secrets manager** (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager). <br>2. If you use `.env`, keep the file **outside VCS** (`.gitignore`). <br>3. Use **CI/CD secrets** to inject env vars at deploy time. <br>4. Enforce a **policy** that all secrets must be sourced from the secrets manager or env vars, never hard‑coded. |
| Deployment process | Manual steps may miss secrets | Automate the injection of env vars via your orchestrator (K8s Secrets, Docker Compose env files, Terraform). |

---

## 5. Low‑Severity – Malformed Payload

| Issue | Why it matters | Fix |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| Malformed payload hitting a secure endpoint | Could lead to injection, crashes, or bypass of auth | • Add **strict JSON schema validation** (e.g., using `ajv` in Node.js, `pydantic` in Python). <br>• Reject payloads that don’t match the schema with a clear error. <br>• Log only the payload **hash** or a sanitized version. |

## 6. Step‑by‑Step Recovery Playbook

| Step | Action | Tool / Command |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **1. Immediate Revocation** | Revoke the exposed API key. | Provider console or CLI (`aws iam delete-access-key`, etc.) |
| **2. Rotate Secrets** | Generate a new key, update env, test. | `openssl rand -hex 32` or provider UI |
| **3. Log Scrubbing** | Mask the key in logs. | `sed -i 's/api_key=[^ ]*/api_key=REDACTED/' *.log` |
| **4. Harden Logging** | Add filters to redact sensitive fields. | Logback, Log4j, Winston, or ELK ingest pipeline |
| **5. Enforce .env Discipline** | Move all secrets to a secrets manager. | Terraform `aws_secretsmanager_secret`, `kubectl create secret`, etc. |
| **6. Implement Fallback Logic** | Add fallback branches in auth flow. | Pseudocode in the auth module |
| **7. Validate Payloads** | Add schema checks. | JSON Schema, pydantic, Joi |
| **8. Audit & Monitor** | Scan repo, logs, and CI for secrets. | `truffleHog`, `git-secrets`, `detect-secrets` |
| **9. Update Policies** | Document secret handling, logging, and fallback procedures. | Confluence or README |

## 7. Checklist for Ongoing Hygiene

- [ ] **Secrets**: All secrets live in a secrets manager or env vars only. No hard‑coded values.
- [ ] **Logging**: All logs filter out fields named `api_key`, `password`, `token`, etc.
- [ ] **Version Control**: `.env` files are in `.gitignore`. No secrets in commits.
- [ ] **Fallbacks**: Every critical operation has a graceful fallback path.
- [ ] **Schema Validation**: All endpoints validate input against a strict schema.
- [ ] **Rotation Cadence**: Keys rotated every 90 days (or per policy).
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Revocation and rotation events are logged and reviewed.

## 8. Final Recommendation

1. **Revoke and rotate** the exposed API key **right now**.  
2. **Add a secrets manager** and move all keys out of code.  
3. **Implement a fallback** for login failures (secondary MFA or password reset).  
4. **Configure log filters** to redact any sensitive fields.  
5. **Enforce `.env` discipline** with CI/CD secrets injection and keep files out of VCS.  
6. **Add strict payload validation** to all secure endpoints.

Follow the playbook above, and you’ll eliminate the immediate risk and harden the system against future credential leaks and hygiene gaps.
