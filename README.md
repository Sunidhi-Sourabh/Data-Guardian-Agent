# 🛡️ DataGuardian Agent  
**Privacy-first hygiene sentinel for indie builders**  
Built for the TiDB AgentX Hackathon by [Sunidhi Sourabh]

---

## 📦 Overview  
DataGuardian Agent is a multi-step Python agent that detects credential leaks, fallback gaps, and hygiene violations in developer logs. It ingests logs into TiDB Serverless, scans for risky patterns, summarizes issues via GPT-OSS, and triggers alerts with branded fallback logic.

Designed for indie developers, this agent runs locally, respects credential boundaries, and adapts to mock mode when `.env` is missing—ensuring safe sharing and resilient demos.

---

## 🧠 Features  
- 🔍 Risk Detection: Flags exposed keys, missing fallbacks, insecure access  
- 🧠 LLM Summarization: Advises recovery steps using GPT-OSS via Groq  
- 📢 Alert Triggering: Sends advisory reports via webhook or CLI  
- 🔁 Fallback Messaging: Handles GPT/DB failures with branded clarity  
- 🧾 Audit Logging: Tracks alert status and fallback events  
- 🧪 Modular CLI Flow: Each step is independently testable and cinematic  
- 📊 Dashboard Visualization: Real-time charts and advisory panel  
- ⚠️ Mock Mode: Safe fallback when `.env` is missing  
- ⬇️ Downloadable Advisory Report

## 🧱 Architecture  
ingest_logs.py       → Ingest logs into TiDB

search_risks.py      → Detect hygiene risks and assign scores

summarize_risks.py   → Summarize issues and suggest fixes via GPT-OSS

trigger_alert.py     → Push advisory report via webhook or CLI

fallback.py          → Provide branded fallback messages and log events

run_pipeline.py      → One-click orchestration of the full pipeline

app.py               → Flask server for dashboard rendering

dashboard.html       → Frontend layout with Chart.js and advisory panel

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo  
git clone https://github.com/sunidhisourabh/DataGuardian-Agent.git
cd DataGuardian-Agent

## 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

## 3. Create .env from Template
cp .env.template .env

  Fill in your credentials:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here  
TIDB_HOST=https://your_tidb_endpoint  
TIDB_USER=your_tidb_user  
TIDB_PASSWORD=your_tidb_password  
TIDB_DATABASE=data_guardian  
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your_webhook_url

## 4. Install Dependencies
pip install flask pymysql markdown2 python-dotenv

Or use:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## 5. Run the Pipeline
python run_pipeline.py         #One Click - Risk Report Generated

Or one-by-one command:

python ingest_logs.py  
python search_risks.py  
python summarize_risks.py  
python trigger_alert.py --mode webhook

## 6.Launch the Dashboard
python app.py               
(Visit http://localhost:5000 to view the agent’s dashboard.)

## 📄 Demo Assets
- demo_assets/risk_advice_report.md → Advisory generated by the agent
- demo_assets/alert_log.txt → Alerts triggered during pipeline execution
- demo_assets/venv_setup_output.txt → Output from creating and activating the virtual environment
- demo_assets/dependency_install_output.txt → Output from installing required dependencies
- demo_assets/run_pipeline_output.txt → Full CLI output from executing the pipeline

---

## 🧾 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TiDB Serverless account
- Groq API key for GPT-OSS
- Webhook endpoint (Slack, Discord, etc.)

---

## 🎬 Demo Walkthrough
To view the agent in action:
- Run run_pipeline.py to execute all steps
- Launch app.py and open the dashboard
- Explore:
- 📊 Risk Score Distribution
- 🔍 Pattern Frequency
- 🧠 Advisory Panel
- 📡 Alert Log Viewer
- ⚠️ Mock Mode Banner (if .env is missing)
- ⬇️ Download Button for advisory report
Even without credentials, the dashboard runs in mock mode for safe sharing.

## 🔐 Credential Hygiene
This agent is designed with privacy-first principles:
- .env is never pushed
- .env.template guides safe configuration
- Mock mode ensures fallback logic and demo resilience
- You may delete your .env before submission without breaking functionality
